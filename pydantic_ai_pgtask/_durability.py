    Attach it to an agent via `capabilities=[PGTaskDurability()]` and call `agent.run()`
    inside any pgtask handler:
    every model request, MCP call, and function tool call is wrapped in `task.step(...)`,
    so a worker crash mid-run resumes from the last completed step instead of restarting -
    no tokens are re-spent, and side effects run once. Outside a durable task the
    capability is transparent and the run is a normal, non-durable agent run.

    The capability discovers the agent's model, name, and toolsets automatically when it
    is bound to the agent. Step results are stored in Postgres as JSON, so a checkpointed
    tool's return value must be JSON-serializable.

    Example:
        ```python
        from pydantic_ai import Agent
        from pydantic_ai_pgtask import PGTaskDurability

        agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5.2', name='analyst', capabilities=[PGTaskDurability()])
